# Device Fix Summary

## Problem
The code was failing with `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'type'` when attempting to use steering functionality. This occurred because:

1. The `get_device()` utility function returns either:
   - A **string** (`"cpu"`, `"cuda"`, `"mps"`) for most cases
   - A **torch.device object** for TPU cases

2. Throughout the codebase, code was checking `self.device.type == 'cpu'`, assuming `self.device` was always a `torch.device` object

3. When `self.device` was a string, calling `.type` on it caused the AttributeError

## Solution
Modified all HCWS component initialization code to always convert device to `torch.device` objects:

```python
# OLD CODE:
from .device_utils import get_device
self.device = get_device(device)

# NEW CODE:
from .device_utils import get_device
raw_device = get_device(device)

# Convert to torch.device for consistent handling
if isinstance(raw_device, str):
    self.device = torch.device(raw_device)
else:
    self.device = raw_device
```

## Files Modified

1. **hcws/model.py**: Main HCWS model class
2. **hcws/encoder.py**: Instruction encoder (T5-based)
3. **hcws/simple_encoder.py**: Alternative simple encoder
4. **hcws/conceptors.py**: Conceptor and ConceptorBank classes
5. **hcws/controller.py**: Steering controller
6. **hcws/hyper_network.py**: HyperNetwork for generating conceptors

Additionally updated string comparisons:
- Changed `self.device == 'cpu'` to `self.device.type == 'cpu'`
- Changed `self.device != 'cpu'` to `self.device.type != 'cpu'`

## Demo Improvements

### demo.py Changes:

1. **Simplified Output**: Removed verbose warnings, notes, and status messages
   - Now shows only: Prompt → Unsteered Response → Steered Response

2. **Auto-Registration**: Automatically registers steering instructions
   - Checks if instruction needs training with `model.needs_retraining()`
   - Registers instruction with `model.update_trained_instructions()`
   - Enables zero-shot steering without explicit training

3. **Cleaner Format**: 
   - Reduced initialization messages
   - Minimal status output
   - Focus on demonstrating the steering effect

### Test Files Added:

1. **test_device_fix.py**: Validates torch.device conversion works correctly
2. **test_steering.py**: Quick test with GPT-2 to verify steering functionality

## Verification

All changes verified with:
- ✅ Device handling test passes
- ✅ Model initialization works on CPU
- ✅ GPT-2 steering test successful (unsteered vs steered outputs differ)
- ✅ No AttributeError on `.type` attribute

## Impact

- **Before**: Steering failed with AttributeError, verbose output, no auto-training
- **After**: Steering works, clean output, automatic instruction registration

The fix ensures consistent device handling across all HCWS components and enables the demonstration to work properly on CPU-only systems.
